### Project Description
**BU Menu Scraper & Recommendation System**  
This project scrapes Boston University's dining hall menus, analyzes user preferences, and recommends personalized meal choices. It identifies dishes a user is most likely to enjoy by combining item popularity, frequency, and station (category) ratings. Unique optimizations include **reverse-frequency weighting** (prioritizing rare items) and **station diversity** (ensuring recommendations cover multiple food stations).

---

### Key Features
1. **Automated Menu Scraping**
   - Fetches daily menus (breakfast, lunch, dinner) from BU's dining website.
   - Structures data by date, meal, item, and station (e.g., "Pizza Station").

2. **Personalized Recommendations**
   - Uses `User_Ratings.json` to weight items based on individual preferences.
   - Recommends **top 15 items** per meal, ensuring **one item per station** for variety.

3. **Smart Weighting System**
   - **Composite Score** = `Popularity (60%) + Reverse Frequency (30%) + Station Rating (10%)`:
      - **Popularity**: User-provided ratings (1–5).
      - **Reverse Frequency**: Rewards rarely appearing items (e.g., weekly specials).
      - **Station Rating**: Average user rating per station (e.g., "Grill Station: 4.2/5").

4. **Efficiency Optimizations**
   - Caches menus locally to minimize scraping.
   - Recalculates weights only when new data is available.

---

### Technical Implementation
#### Core Functionality
- **Scraping Engine** (`scraper.py`):
   - Uses `BeautifulSoup` to parse HTML from BU Dining’s website.
   - Extracts nested menu data (date → meal → item → station).
- **Significance Calculator** (`Calculate_Significance.py`):
   - Computes weights: `reverse_frequency()`, `category_weights()`, `integrate_weights()`.
   - Generates `User_Menu.json` with final composite scores.
- **Recommendation Handler** (`handler.py`):
   - API-like endpoint (e.g., `lambda_handler`).
   - Returns top 15 items for a given date/meal, filtered by unique stations.

#### Technical Stack
- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `json`, `subprocess`, `collections`
- **Data Flow**:
  Scrape → menu.json → Calculate_Significance → User_Menu.json → Recommendation

### Key Advantages
1. **Personalization**
   - Adapts to individual tastes via dynamic user ratings.
2. **Novelty Promotion**
   - Highlights infrequent items (reverse frequency) to avoid "menu fatigue".
3. **Bias Mitigation**
   - Avoids overrepresenting stations (e.g., recommending 5+ pizza items).
4. **Scalability**
   - Decoupled modules allow easy extensions (e.g., new scoring factors).

### Setup Instructions (Optional)
1. **Install Dependencies**:
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4  
2. **Initialize Files**:
   - `menu.json`: Output from scraper (auto-generated).
   - `User_Ratings.json`: Manually add `{"item_name": rating}` (1–5).
3. **Run**:
   - `scraper.py` to fetch menus.
   - `handler.py` to test recommendations (simulates API event).

### Special Notes & Considerations
- **Reverse-Frequency Edge Case**:  
  If an item appears daily (e.g., fries), its weight approaches `1/high_frequency ≈ 0`. This intentionally de-prioritizes common items.
- **Website Dependency**:  
  BU’s HTML structure changes may break the scraper (requires maintenance).
- **Weight Adjustments**:  
  Tweak the composite formula (60%/30%/10%) in `integrate_weights()` for different behaviors.
