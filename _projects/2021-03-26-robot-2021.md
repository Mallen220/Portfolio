### Project Description
The **2021 FRC Robot (Anubis)** was developed by **Team 1987 (The Broncobots)** for the *FIRST Robotics Competition* game *INFINITE RECHARGE at Home*. As a programming team member, I contributed to the Java-based control system enabling autonomous/teleop ball collection, high-precision shooting, and complex path navigation. The robot won the **Excellence in Engineering Award** and achieved a 2-2-0 record in offseason competitions.

### Key Features
1. **High-Speed Drivetrain**
   - West Coast design with 4 Falcon 500 motors (16.35 ft/s top speed).
   - Closed-loop odometry using CANcoders + NavX gyro for precision.
2. **Ball Collection System**
   - Dual Neo 550 motors driving compression rollers.
   - Pneumatic cylinder deployment for bumper contact.
3. **Spindexer & Shooter**
   - Multi-stage spindexer (3 motors) to organize/feed balls.
   - Falcon 500-powered shooter with Limelight vision targeting.
   - **Auto-RPM adjustment** based on distance to target.
4. **Autonomous Suite**
   - Galactic Search path selection (A/B, Red/Blue).
   - AutoNav challenges (Barrel Run, Slalom, Bounce).
   - Vision-aimed shooting sequences.

---

### Technical Implementation
#### Core Functionality:
- **Command-Based Architecture**: 50+ modular commands (e.g., `AimBot`, `ShootRPM`, `GalacticSearch`).
- **Vision Integration**: Limelight processes target data for real-time shooter RPM/drive alignment.
- **Dynamic Path Planning**: Spline-based autonomous paths with motion profiling.
- **Subsystem Syncing**: Parallel commands for simultaneous ball collection/shooting/driving.

#### Key Code Components:
- **`Drive.java`**: Odometry + path following using `DifferentialDriveOdometry`.
- **`Shooter.java`**: PID-controlled flywheel with interpolation for distance-based RPM.
- **`GalacticSearch.java`**: Color-based path selection using gyro heading.
- **`PowerPort.java`**: Automated shooting sequences with vision alignment.

---

### Technical Stack
- **Languages**: Java (WPILib framework)
- **Motor Control**: CTRE Phoenix API (TalonFX/TalonSRX)
- **Sensors**: Limelight (NetworkTables), CANcoders, NavX AHRS
- **Pneumatics**: Double solenoids for collector/shooter mechanisms
- **Tools**: Shuffleboard for real-time tuning, PathWeaver for trajectory generation

---

### Key Advantages
1. **Vision-Centric Automation**
   - Limelight-driven aiming (`AimBot3`) enabled <1° targeting error.
   - Shooter RPM auto-adjusted using distance interpolation tables.
2. **Autonomous Adaptability**
   - Galactic Search paths dynamically selected via gyro readings.
   - Conditional commands for multi-stage routines (e.g., `PowerPortFirstRun`).
3. **Robust Error Handling**
   - Tolerance checks (`Util.isWithinTolerance()`) for shooter RPM/alignment.
   - Current monitoring to detect spindexer jams.
4. **Efficient Teleop**
   - Single-button workflows (e.g., collect+agitate, aim+shoot).
   - Configurable drive modes (arcade/curvature/tank).

### Special Notes
- **Electronics Innovation**: Upside-down control board doubled as the spindexer floor.
- **Awards**: Excellence in Engineering (At-Home Challenge), Woodie Flowers Finalist (Mentor).
- **Constraints**: Designed for remote competitions; optimized for space-limited home testing.
- **Legacy**: Code structure influenced 2022 robot’s vision/shooter systems.

### Summary
This project showcases advanced robotics programming in Java, emphasizing **real-time vision integration**, **modular command design**, and **autonomous adaptability**. The system’s performance in competition and awards highlights its technical sophistication and reliability under constraints.
