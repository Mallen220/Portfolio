### Project Description: FRC Team 1987 Broncobots - 2022 Robot ("Mystery Machine")
As a programmer for **FRC Team 1987 (Broncobots)**, I developed the software for our 2022 competition robot, "Mystery Machine." This robot competed in the *FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC)* game "Rapid React," focusing on shooting cargo into high/low goals and climbing traversal bars. The robot featured the team’s **first-ever swerve drive system**, achieving **~95% high-goal accuracy** and winning two regionals.

### Key Features
1. **Holonomic Swerve Drive**:
   - 4 independent MK4i modules powered by 8 Falcon 500 motors.
   - Inverted modules for protection and space efficiency.
   - Closed-loop control with CANcoders and NavX gyro for precise odometry.
2. **Autonomous Systems**:
   - Motion-profiled paths via **PathPlanner** for complex routines (e.g., 5-ball auto, cargo stealing).
   - Vision-assisted alignment using **Limelight** for shooting and pose estimation.
3. **Ball Handling**:
   - Pneumatically actuated collector with Falcon 500 motor.
   - Sensor-tracked storage (line sensors + debounced inputs) for ball counting.
   - Dual-flywheel shooter with **RPM interpolation** based on distance.
4. **Climber Automation**:
   - "Climber-in-a-Box" modules with pneumatics and 3D-printed hooks.
   - Sequential auto-climb routines with safety brakes and position control.
5. **Driver Experience**:
   - Rumble feedback, ball-count adjustment, and real-time telemetry via **Shuffleboard**.
   - Compressor/pneumatics management for critical systems.

### Technical Implementation
#### Core Functionality
- **Drivetrain (`DrivetrainSubsystem`)**
   - Utilizes `SwerveDriveKinematics` for module state calculations.
   - `MAX_VELOCITY_METERS_PER_SECOND` (4.97 m/s) and `MAX_ANGULAR_VELOCITY` constraints.
   - Path following with `PPSwerveControllerCommand` (PID + feedforward).
- **Shooter (`ShooterSubsystem`)**
   - Falcon 500s with velocity closed-loop control (`TalonFXControlMode.Velocity`).
   - **InterpolatingTreeMap** to map Limelight distance → RPM (e.g., 2,150 RPM at -1.5°).
   - Pneumatic hood adjustment for trajectory optimization.
- **Storage (`StorageSubsystem`)**
   - Ball tracking via debounced digital sensors and state machines.
   - Neo 550 motors with configurable run speeds for intake/shooting.
- **Climber (`TelescopeSubsystem`)**
   - Closed-loop position control with Falcon 500s and limit switches.
   - Current limiting (70A) and voltage compensation for safety.

#### Automation Highlights
- **Shooting Sequence**:
  new ConditionalCommand(
    new Shoot(m_shooter, m_storage, m_drivetrain, m_limelight, m_compressor),
    ... // Rumble feedback if target not visible
  )

- **Climber Workflow**:
  new SequentialCommandGroup(
    new TelescopeAutoHome(m_telescopeFront),
    new ClimbStep1(m_telescopeFront, m_compressor),
    ... // Engage brakes after extension
  )

### Technical Stack
- **Languages**: Java (WPILib)
- **Libraries**:
   - Phoenix (CTRE) for motor control.
   - PathPlanner for autonomous trajectories.
   - NavX for gyroscope data.
   - Limelight for vision processing.
- **Hardware**:
   - Falcon 500/Neo motors, TalonFX/Spark MAX controllers.
   - REV Pneumatics Hub, Digital sensors.
- **Tooling**: Shuffleboard for telemetry, Git for version control.

### Key Advantages
1. **Precision Movement**: Swerve odometry enabled <5cm pose accuracy during autonomous.
2. **Adaptive Shooting**: Interpolated RPM tables allowed consistent scoring from 1–16m.
3. **Driver Safety**:
   - Current limiting on climber motors.
   - Auto-shutdown for storage/shooter on faults.
4. **Competition Readiness**:
   - 10+ autonomous routines (e.g., `FiveBallAuto`, `RightTrickTaxi`).
   - Pressure monitoring for pneumatics.

### Special Notes
- **Innovation**: First Broncobots robot to use swerve drive and vision-based shooting.

- **Complex Controls**:
   - Swerve used **feedforward compensation** (`SimpleMotorFeedforward`) for dynamic response.
   - Climber employed **motion magic** for smooth extension/retraction.
- **Debugging**: Extensive Shuffleboard logging for real-time tuning (e.g., RPM error, pose tracking).

This project honed my skills in **real-time systems**, **motion control**, and **cross-functional collaboration** (mechanical/electrical teams). Codebase: ~5k lines of Java.
